# Rat Technologies E-Commerce Website and App

The E-Commerce Website and App is the place where people can go to buy prebuilt PCs, laptops or even individual parts (subject to company's stock). We want to have a central place where people can buy their PCs, laptops and even parts from a trusted source as trying to get parts is already a hassle considering that you have to go outside to Rocher to buy the parts, or wait a few weeks to get it from online services such as Amazon and Newegg without mentioning the possibility of you getting literal weights in a GPU box instead of an actual GPU.

This website includes points upon purchase of a prebuilt PC or laptop to incentivise people to get it fully built instead of buying the individual parts.

## Design Process

The Website and App as said above is a place where people buy their prebuilt PCs, laptops or individual parts without ever worrying about instances where they would get scammed as it is coming straight from the company themselves. However, if the products are just in one bundle, the user would get confused and would click away. Thus, the products are segmented into catagories for the users to easily navigate through the website depending on what they want from their prebuilt PCs or laptop. Parts are segmented into their part type from CPUs, GPUs, RAM and storage for the more technical users to easily navigate through. However, since we want the users to buy the prebuilts or laptops instead of buying the individual parts to build for themselves, we made the point system so that you earn points only if you buy a prebuilt or a laptop.

Let's say there is a buyer who just wants a whole lots of RGB for their rig, instead of going through amazon, shopee or lazada to potentially get ripped off and find out they have parts from 10 years ago, they can go to our website to buy one of our desktop prebuilts in the category "RGB Galore" and still be able to play on most of the latest games there is to offer.
